# Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the on-demand use of online computing services, such as data storage or program execution. Cloud Computing covers any on-demand delivery of computing resources, and is therefore a wide-ranging umbrella term.

The key advantage is that instead of being responsible for the maintenance of the hardware and needing to scale the process, it is possible to rent access to these services instead. This approach makes capacity highly scalable, which greatly saves on infrastructure costs. 

The pay-as-you-go model offered by many cloud providers also means that costs are more controllable during times of lower demand, as opposed to constant maintenance costs when running hardware.

Due to most cloud providers having backups, the reliability of a service is laso greatly increased.

### Disadvantages

There are, however, downsides to cloud services. As data is passed to a cloud provider, this could present a security issue. While security is likely to be a key concern for any cloud provider, the full extent of their security protocols is not known to the user.

Transparency is a big potential issue with using cloud computing, as the user may not know where your data is being stored (which can have an impact as different countries have different strengths of data protection laws), whether a breach has occurred, etc.

It can become problematic if data stored with one cloud provider is incompatible with another provider, leaving the user of cloud computing “locked in” to a particular provider. Similarly, if a provider stops providing the user with a particular service, it may be a problem if this is something a service is completely dependent on.

### Types of cloud deployment:

- On Premises/Internal, Off Premises/Third Party, Hybrid.

- On Premises/internal may be useful fo some services that require stricter security, such as banking or government data storage. Hybrids include a mixture of the two, where particularly sensitive data might be stored on an internal cloud, while some customer services may be suited for third party/external cloud services.

### Different Models of Cloud Services

Note that while the services are provided, the user still has to set up and configure them:


- On-Site - Everything managed by user, no cloud provider involved.

- Infrastructure as a service - Service provider manages Servers, Storage, Networking, and Virtualisation. Operating System, Runtime, Middleware, Data and applications are user responsibility. 

- Platform as a service - similar to previous, but OS, Middleware and Runtime also covered by Cloud Provider.

- Software as a Service - Everything covered by cloud Provider, only configuring and setup to be managed by the user.

 Cloud Computing is very different to virtualisation, and the two must not be confused. Virtualisation is the technology that led to cloud computing, as it enables a layer between hardware and software, but cloud computing is a service that employs this technology to provide scalable computing capacity.
